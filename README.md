### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to       solve?
The business of Regulatory and Compliance is complex, this because it has multiple moving parts, and the nature of the domain is continue shifting and changing. The velocity veracity of change that occurs in regulatory space cause it to be problematic for that reason, most regulatory information is stored in silos with high number of redundancies thus reports are not automated, and knowledge sharing is inefficient.

###	What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Deloitte advertised RegHub as an end-to-end platform for simplifying complex regulatory compliance. RegHub platform includes Horizon scanning, regulatory universe, compliance change management and compliance monitoring. Very few companies have End-to-end capability like Deloitte. For instance, many startup or small companies are very inspirational but not fully implementational. Meaning, they do not have the continual groundbreaking technology and financial capabilities to build a regulatory Platform like RegHub. Investopedia stated, that in 2019, the failure rate of startups was around 90%. Research concludes 21.5% of startups fail in the first year, 30% in the second year, 50% in the fifth year, and 70% in their 10th year. However, I feel the unfair advantage Deloitte has is the decades of knowledge that the firm has with regulatory challenges and the industry brand Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited. SMB Advisor stated that Deloitte revenue went over $43 billion last year and named #1 ranked accounting firm by Inside Public Accounting in 2017 as well as #1 in consulting based on revenue by Gartner. More importantly, Deloitte Consulting provides audit, financial advisory, legal, management, risk advisory, and tax consulting services to nearly 90 percent of the Fortune 500.
