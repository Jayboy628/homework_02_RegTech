<h3>Overview and Origin</h3>
<p>Deloitte estimate that they are 220 regulatory revision to keep track of daily and more importantly, regulatory fines exceeding US$ 345 Billon issued since 2009. Thus, the cost of compliance is increasing substantially, and the need for companies to develop technology-based solutions are in high demand. The domain I choose is RegTech and the company is Deloitte however I focus on a Project that Deloitte explored called RegTech Universe 2021 along with their RegTech solution called RegHub.</p>
