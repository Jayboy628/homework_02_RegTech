<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Deloitte estimate that they are 220 regulatory revision to keep track of daily and more importantly, regulatory fines exceeding US$ 345 Billon issued since 2009. Thus, the cost of compliance is increasing substantially, and the need for companies to develop technology-based solutions are in high demand. The domain I choose is RegTech and the company is Deloitte however I focus on a Project that Deloitte explored called RegTech Universe 2021 along with their RegTech solution called RegHub.</p>

<strong>What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve?</strong>
<p>Since the financial crisis of 2008, Financial services regulation has expanded at an astonish rate. The challenge is that Regulatory and Compliance as layers of complexity, this is because of the continues shifting and changing in regulatory requirements. Secondly not adherent to the regulator law and obligations has cost financial companies heavily. Complianceweek.com stated that Financial institutions have been hit with $10.4 billion in global fines and penalties related to anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), data privacy, and MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) <mark>regulations in 2020, bringing the total to $46.4 billion for those types of breaches since 2008.</mark></p>

<strong>Who is the company's intended customer? </strong>
<p>Deloitte as many clients for instance, Metlife, Morgan Stanley, Berkshire Hathaway, The Blackstone Group, Federal National Mortgage Association, Microsoft, GM, Procter & Gamble, Apollo Global Management, Boeing. The above companies are leaders in their respective industries and are affected by regulatory challenges. “A large number of our clients are taking aggressive action to determine how they can use these technologies within their ecosystems, Krishna said. "'They’re acting as venture capitalists and investing in their internal projects to see what specific problems these technologies can solve. Some are joining different consortiums—you see this a lot with blockchain—to partner and work with the industry. Others are watching and seeing what happens next. There’s been a tremendous response within the industry.'"</p>

<strong>Is there any information about the market size?</strong>
<p>The global RegTech Market was estimated at USD 5.31 Billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 33.1 Billion by 2026. The global RegTech Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.27% from 2019 to 2026.</p>
<strong>What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)</strong>
<p>Deloitte advertised RegHub as an end-to-end platform for simplifying complex regulatory compliance. RegHub platform includes Horizon scanning, regulatory universe, compliance change management and compliance monitoring. Very few companies have End-to-end capability like Deloitte. 
For instance, many startup or small companies are very inspirational but not fully implementational. Meaning, they do not have the continual groundbreaking technology and financial capabilities to build a regulatory Platform like RegHub. Investopedia stated, that in 2019, the failure rate of startups was around 90%. Research concludes 21.5% of startups fail in the first year, 30% in the second year, 50% in the fifth year, and 70% in their 10th year. 
However, I feel the unfair advantage Deloitte has is the decades of knowledge that the firm has with regulatory challenges and the industry brand Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited. SMB Advisor stated that Deloitte revenue went over $43 billion last year and named #1 ranked accounting firm by Inside Public Accounting in 2017 as well as #1 in consulting based on revenue by Gartner. More importantly, Deloitte Consulting provides audit, financial advisory, legal, management, risk advisory, and tax consulting services to nearly 90 percent of the Fortune 500.

<p>Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, big data analytics, distributed ledger technology, and the Internet of Things (IoT), are disrupting traditional business models.
